								<h4>The Problem</h4>
								<p>
								Inadequate tailor made solutions for business development limit the profitability of many businesses in 
								Africa. Specifically, in agribusiness; Smallholder farmers lack access to mechanization services leading 
								to low production. Mechanization service providers lack models for their hiring businesses and platforms 
								to access farmers who need their services. Smallholder farmers suffer a cash-flow problem - their income 
								peaks at harvest time, but planting season is when they need cash the most to purchase quality seeds and 
								fertilizers. Sadly, this is normally when the money has already run out. They also suffer long chain of 
								middle men during marketing of their farm products giving them very low prices for their farm outputs.

								<h4>The Solution</h4>
								<p>
								Vart Africa Solutions Limited provides tailor made solutions to entrepreneurs for their business development 
								and consulting.  We implement a “VART-SPACE-MODEL” that provides solutions to challenges along agricultural 
								value chain by use of technology. Vart-Space-Model uses Hello Tractor Technology (Uber for Tractors) to 
								connect farmers to mechanization services and Tractor owners to track their daily Tractor operations through 
								their smart phone. This technology employs youth as booking agents who help farmers to book for Tractor 
								services through smart phones. The booking agents alongside other vendors sell scratch cards to farmers which 
								help farmers save little by little for seeds and trainings in our system. We then deliver their seeds at the 
								beginning of every planting season and provide training on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP).
